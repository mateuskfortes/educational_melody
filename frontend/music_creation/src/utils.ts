 * Calculates the vertical distance (in percentage or pixels) from a reference point

 * - Starts from a base offset (475).
 * - Subtracts an amount based on the octave (each octave shifts by 87.5).
 * - Subtracts an amount based on the note position within the octave (each note shifts by 12.5).
 * 
 * @param note - The note object containing `note` (name) and `octave`.
 * @returns The calculated vertical top distance for the note.

 * - isTop: boolean indicating if the note is above the top bound (true) or below the bottom bound (false).
 * - distance: the absolute distance by which the note exceeds the bound.
 * 
 * Logic:
 * - If `topDistance` is negative, the note is above the visible area.
 * - If `topDistance - 100` is positive, the note is below the bottom visible bound.
 * - Otherwise, the note is within bounds.

 * - The `top` number indicates how many beats are in a measure.

 * - Different bottom values correspond to different note types (whole, half, quarter, etc).

 * - Maps the bottom number to the corresponding note class.
